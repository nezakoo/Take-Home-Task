# Take-Home-Task
**Task 1**

A script that writes the numbers from 1 - 10 in random order.
Each number appears only once.

**Usage:**
1. Download the bash script
2. Make it executable
3. Run by entering the script name 

The script by default shows numbers from 1 to 10
You can enter max number in args ie _script.sh 20_

**The limitations:**
The script can make arrays only from 1. Although it could be fixed by play around with the _seq_ function.
There is could be added, "if number checker" for arguments.

**Task 2**
